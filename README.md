# Ensembles-of-deep-neural-networks-for-the-automatic-detection-of-building-facade-defects-from-images

## Abstract

Preserving the value of buildings and ensuring performance levels within acceptable parameters throughout their lifespan necessitates constant monitoring. Indeed, the absence of a continuous monitoring process poses a risk to the guaranteed use of the building. However, traditional diagnostic strategies, which rely on experts to visually inspect the built system components, result in time-consuming and expensive procedures.  
Thus, they may be neither cost-effective nor sustainable. The emergence of artificial intelligence based automatic monitoring in recent years has provided a valuable supplement to conventional inspection practices, potentially offering a supporting tool for building maintenance in smart cities. Exploiting machine learning algorithms for detecting or classifying building facade defects from acquired images is a promising strategy for automatic building monitoring.  
For this reason, in this work, we introduced a novel and effective classification protocol, based on different ensemble strategies of complex and recent deep neural networks, namely Vision Transformers and ConvNexts, for building facade defects automatic classification.  
We analyzed a custom dataset, named Facade Building Defects (FBD), containing building facade images labeled into four different defect classes, that we introduced in this work and released as open access.
